      <h1>Handmade scratching posts<br>for prestigious feline homes.</h1>
      These designs came about after making a few cat scratching posts for my friends.
      We wanted all natural fibers instead of carpeting.
      Next we tipped the post itself back and curved it like a tree base to help your home owner reach out.
      It would be great to attach a cat scratching post to the wall, but this wasn't an option for us.
      For that reason, the legs form a wider base than many posts on the market to provide a sturdy clawing.
      Finally the construction follows classic furniture design for added strength and long life.
      I attached the rope with simple U-shaped nails and no glue so that it can be replaced, and I keep the rear legs flush to the back wall in case your space is limited and you need to sneak them behind another piece of furniture. I hope your kitties will enjoy the look of finished wood in their home!
