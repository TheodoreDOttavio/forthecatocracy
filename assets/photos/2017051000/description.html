<p class="lead">27" scratching post & dinner table

<p class="small"><b>A perfect addition for a sunny window.</b>
<br>Solid wood construction with replaceable sisal fiber rope.
The front scratching post has a slight curve to help your cat stretch out and claw away.


<p class="small">Legs are easily removed and secured strong enough to hold very heavy cats.
I have pressed all my weight on the top to stress test it. It does support a good 20lbs on the front corners without tipping. This is probably best for a home with a single smaller cat that won't throw their food all over the place.

<p class="lead">Dimensions:</p>

<p class="small">
  27 1/2" high (floor to top)
  <br>26" x 16" top
  <br>22 3/4" wide (outer edges of the back legs)
  <br>26" from the back edge to the bottom front of the scratching post.

<p class="small">
  This was built in a cat free environment to ensure your home owner will be the first to mark it as their personal piece.
