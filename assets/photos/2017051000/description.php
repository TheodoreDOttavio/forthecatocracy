<?php include("_description.php"); ?>
I have pressed all my weight on the top to stress test it. It does support a good 20lbs on the front corners without tipping. This is probably best for a home with a single smaller cat that won't throw their food all over the place.

<p class="lead">Dimensions:</p>

<p class="small">
  27 1/2" high (floor to top)
  <br>26" x 16" top
  <br>22 3/4" wide (outer edges of the back legs)
  <br>26" from the back edge to the bottom front of the scratching post.
