<p class="small">Solid wood construction with replaceable sisal fiber rope.
The front scratching post has a slight curve to help your cat stretch out and claw away.

<p class="small">Legs are easily removed and secured strong enough to hold very heavy cats.
I have pressed all my weight on the top to stress test it. It is built to last!

  This was built in a cat free environment to ensure your home owner will be the first to mark it as their personal piece.
