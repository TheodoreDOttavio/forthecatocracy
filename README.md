# Furniture for the Catocracy
A straightforward site to promote artisan woodworking peices.

## What it is not:

No shopping cart. Single purchases, no quantity, and low volume.
No MVC framework. Very few pages, and no need for a database.

## to add products:
/assets/photos/[product id # yymmdd[2 digit sequence]]/*-thumb.jpg
/assets/photos/[product id # yymmdd[2 digit sequence]]/*.jpg
...or a json file with subfolder description and price?
